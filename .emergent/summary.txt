The previous AI engineer successfully transformed Codex into Vectort.io, replicating emergent.sh. Key achievements include a full-stack (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) implementation with comprehensive authentication, a user dashboard, and an advanced AI application generator. Significant effort was dedicated to bug fixes, such as persistent voice recognition issues and UI contrast problems, alongside security enhancements. Monetization was introduced via a credit-based pricing system, including Stripe integration. Functionalities like file upload, GitHub integration (save/fork), and an Ultra Mode toggle were added to the AI generation interface. The engineer also prepped the codebase for numerous third-party integrations (SendGrid, AWS S3, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable) by adding environment variable placeholders and installing libraries. The current critical phase involves deploying the entire application to a user-provided Contabo server, where the AI engineer is providing manual deployment steps after facing issues with automated DNS and SSH private key access.

The overarching goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of emergent.sh, branded as Vectort.io, capable of generating diverse websites. This included: robust authentication, a user dashboard for project management, and an advanced AI generation system supporting 25+ project types (Web App, Mobile, API, E-commerce, etc.) with quick and advanced modes. Key features like microphone-enabled voice-to-text input, and essential business pages (Features, Pricing, FAQs) were required. Emphasis was on 100% functionality, bug-free operation, and strong security. Monetization involved a credit-based pricing system, mirroring Emergent's model (e.g., 100/0, 250/0, 400/0 USD packages), with 10 free credits upon registration and 0 monthly credits. This system necessitated Stripe integration for top-ups. More recently, the user requested advanced functionalities within the project description area, including file upload, GitHub save/fork, an Ultra Mode toggle, and a functional microphone, with an improved UI (buttons below text, larger icons). Finally, full third-party integrations akin to Emergent (GitHub OAuth, SendGrid/Email, AWS S3, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable) and automated deployment to a Contabo server with a custom LWS.fr domain were requested.

================================================================================

To run Docker as a non-privileged user, consider setting up the
Docker daemon in rootless mode for your user:

    dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

Visit https://docs.docker.com/go/rootless/ to learn about rootless mode.


To run the Docker daemon as a fully privileged service, but granting non-root
users access, refer to https://docs.docker.com/go/daemon-access/

WARNING: Access to the remote API on a privileged Docker daemon is equivalent
         to root access on the host. Refer to the 'Docker daemon attack surface'
         documentation for details: https://docs.docker.com/go/attack-surface/

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was focused on deploying the Vectort.io application to the user's Contabo server. The user had successfully established an SSH connection to their Contabo server from their local MacBook (), providing proof of connection in the chat.

The deployment process had encountered several roadblocks:
1.  **DNS Configuration**: Automated configuration attempts for  via the LWS.fr API () failed repeatedly due to issues with API authentication/headers, despite the user providing API keys and login credentials. The AI engineer reverted to providing manual DNS configuration instructions for the user.
2.  **SSH Access for Automated Deployment**: The AI engineer attempted to create an  script to automate DNS, SSH, and deployment. This failed because the user initially provided only a public SSH key, while the AI engineer required the private key for automated SSH. After clarification, the user successfully SSHed into the server from their local machine, but the AI engineer's automated script still couldn't use a password or the public key for its own SSH operations.

As a result of these persistent automation difficulties, the AI engineer has now pivoted to providing direct, copy-paste commands for the user to execute themselves on their *already active* SSH terminal connection to the Contabo server. The AI engineer has prepared an  script for this purpose.

This follows extensive work on:
*   Implementing a comprehensive credit-based pricing system with Stripe integration (using live keys).
*   Updating the  frontend to reflect credit packages.
*   Enhancing the  component in  to include file upload, GitHub save/fork, Ultra Mode, and microphone options, with revised UI placement (buttons below the textarea) and sizing, and fixing a recurring  JavaScript error related to emoji rendering.
*   Fixing an authentication issue in the frontend  using an Axios interceptor to ensure proper JWT token handling, enabling successful code generation.
*   Setting up environment variables and installing libraries for multiple third-party integrations (GitHub OAuth, SendGrid, AWS S3, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable).
