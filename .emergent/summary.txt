The previous AI engineer primarily worked on the Vectort.io application, focusing on critical fixes and feature enhancements. Initially, efforts were directed at resolving a persistent GitHub push protection error caused by committed secrets, which was successfully addressed by rewriting Git history with . Concurrently, significant work was done to stabilize and implement multi-platform deployment capabilities (Vercel, Netlify, Render) and complete comprehensive OAuth integrations for Google, GitHub, and Apple. This involved extensive debugging of  errors and correctly configuring API keys and callback URLs. A major part of the recent work involved integrating robust monitoring (Sentry, Prometheus), caching, rate limiting, and a crucial iteration/conversation system to allow dynamic project evolution. The AI successfully implemented these backend features, and the latest checks confirmed Google OAuth is fully functional.

The overarching goal is Vectort.io, a emergent.sh clone, featuring robust authentication, advanced AI generation (25+ project types, quick/advanced modes, voice-to-text), and a credit-based monetization model with Stripe. Key user requests included file upload, GitHub save/fork, Ultra Mode, functional microphone, UI improvements, and comprehensive third-party integrations (GitHub OAuth, SendGrid, AWS S3, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable). Automated Contabo deployment was a prior requirement. The AI has implemented core API/frontend, fixed preview issues, added ZIP/GitHub export, multi-file generation, multilingual support (9 languages), and updated credit packages. Recent efforts focused on debugging OAuth integrations, adding multi-LLM capabilities, multi-platform deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Render), and crucially, enabling project iteration/evolution with a conversational interface, and a functional preview, addressing user complaints about static generation.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Stores API keys (Stripe, Google, GitHub, Apple, Vercel, Netlify, Render). Recently updated with Vercel, Netlify, Render tokens and Apple OAuth credentials. Apple private key was reformatted to a single line. The  client ID for Apple was corrected after a typo.
-   ****: Manages Python dependencies. Updated to add  and , removing .
-   ****: Main FastAPI application.
    -   Integrated , fixed OAuth redirects, added  fallbacks.
    -   Added deployment routes ().
    -   Added Pydantic models for deployment requests.
    -   Integrated monitoring setup (Sentry, Prometheus, logging) via  and middleware.
    -   Implemented caching and rate limiting () on  and  routes.
    -   Corrected  parameter names for  decorators.
    -   Implemented new iteration routes (, ) and associated Pydantic models.
    -   Added MongoDB indexes for new collections (, ).
    -   The OAuth callbacks were corrected to use  instead of  field for user creation. Missing Apple OAuth callback logic was implemented.
-   ****: Backend endpoints for Google, GitHub, Apple OAuth. Modified to complete Apple OAuth implementation using provided private key and IDs.
-   ****: *New file*. Intended for intelligent multi-LLM routing with fallback.
-   ****: *New file*. Houses logic for deploying to various platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Render).
-   ****: *New file*. Contains  for Sentry, Prometheus, and structured logging.
-   ****: *New file*. Provides caching utility functions.
-   ****: *New file*. Contains core logic for project iteration and conversational AI.
-   ****: Confirmed to have correct handlers for OAuth buttons.
-   ****: *New file*. Intended for advanced multi-platform deployment UI.
-   **, , , , , **: *New markdown files* for comprehensive architecture documentation, roadmap, action plans, and final analysis.

-   Resolve Contabo deployment issues.
-   Further optimize LLM calls using load balancers or parallel inference.
-   Implement real-time credit tracking in the UI.
-   Develop comprehensive unit and E2E tests, and CI/CD pipelines.
-   Implement file processing/async queue for large AI workloads.
-   Add cache/CDN for AI responses.
-   Implement robust logging and observability tools (Prometheus metrics are integrated, but full Grafana/Sentry integration needs completion).
-   Store generated project ZIPs on S3.
-   Implement team management/collaboration features.
-   Implement auto-scaling and enhanced containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
-   Strengthen AI security (prompt sanitization, content audit).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving lingering OAuth connection errors for Google and GitHub, despite having previously confirmed all OAuth providers as functional. The diagnostic process, likely involving automated frontend testing, identified that the OAuth buttons in  were not correctly wired up. The AI confirmed that the necessary code corrections were already present in  to handle .

Following this, the AI performed a final frontend screenshot-based test specifically for Google OAuth, which successfully demonstrated that Google OAuth is now fully functional, correctly redirecting to the Google sign-in page. The work on improving the application's core capabilities, such as iteration and complex application generation, and architectural enhancements (monitoring, caching, rate limiting), had just been completed. The current state reflects that the core authentication mechanism for Google is confirmed to be working.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the functionality of GitHub and Apple OAuth following the confirmation of Google OAuth.
