The AI engineer's work pivoted from failed Contabo deployment to stabilizing the application on an Emergent server. Initial efforts focused on verifying existing functionality, updating Stripe API keys to achieve 100% backend functionality, and then implementing and debugging OAuth integrations for Google, GitHub, and Apple. This involved creating new backend routes, frontend components, and fixing redirection/validation errors. Subsequently, the engineer embarked on a comprehensive translation effort for 9 languages, a task repeatedly pushed by the user to 100% completion despite its significant time investment. The current critical blocker is a persistent GitHub push protection error caused by committed documentation files containing secrets, preventing any further Git operations. The AI is now attempting to resolve this by rewriting Git history, currently being blocked by uncommitted changes.

<product_requirements>
The goal is Vectort.io, a clone of emergent.sh, featuring authentication, comprehensive project management, and an advanced AI generation system with over 25 project types (quick/advanced modes, voice-to-text). It includes a credit-based monetization model with Stripe integration. User requests covered file upload, GitHub save/fork, an Ultra Mode, a functional microphone, UI improvements, and full third-party integrations (GitHub OAuth, SendGrid, AWS S3, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable). Automated deployment to a Contabo server was a critical initial requirement. The AI has implemented core API/frontend, fixed preview issues, added ZIP export, built GitHub export and multi-file generation logic, integrated multilingual support (9 languages), and updated credit packages. The primary unresolved task remains successful Contabo deployment/update, and recent efforts focused on debugging OAuth integrations on the Emergent server and completing app-wide translation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was primarily focused on two major areas:
1.  **Comprehensive Application Translation:** The AI was actively working on translating the entire application into 9 languages. This involved generating comprehensive JSON translation files (e.g., , , , , ) with all necessary keys. It had begun modifying  to utilize these translations, specifically for navigation elements. This is a large, ongoing task, and the user repeatedly insisted on 100% completion, including sections like Features, Pricing, FAQs, despite the AI estimating significant time (4-6 hours).
2.  **Resolving GitHub Push Protection Errors:** A critical blocker to further progress is a recurring Git push protection error. This error occurs because sensitive data (Google OAuth Client ID/Secret, Stripe API Key) was inadvertently committed into documentation files (, ) within the Git history. The AI had identified these files and attempted to stage their removal. However, the last reported action indicated that the attempt to rewrite Git history (WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch...) was blocked by uncommitted changes. The immediate goal is to overcome this Git issue to allow further code commits and pushes.

Commit current frontend translation changes, then remove documentation files containing secrets from Git history.
