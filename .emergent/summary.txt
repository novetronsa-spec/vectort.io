The trajectory outlines a rapid evolution of the Vectort.io application. Initially, the AI engineer debugged critical functional gaps: an incorrect 2/4 credit system for initial project generation (instead of 7/14), and artificial 5-file limitations. These were fixed by updating  and generator prompts. Subsequently, the user requested significant architectural enhancements, leading to the implementation of a multi-agent system, expanding from 6 to 10 agents with specialized roles. This was further augmented with a 12-agent self-evolving, self-healing ML system incorporating Fibonacci ratios for optimal performance. A real-time streaming UI via SSE and a comprehensive auto-test framework were also integrated. The final phase introduced multi-language support, professional templates, and further architecture review. The immediate challenge is optimizing JavaScript generation, as a recent end-to-end test for it failed.

Vectort.io aims to be an emergent.sh clone, offering robust authentication, advanced AI code generation (25+ project types, quick/advanced, voice-to-text), and a credit-based monetization model. Core features include file upload, GitHub integration, Ultra Mode, functional microphone, multi-LLM support, and multi-platform deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Render). A key requirement is project iteration with a conversational interface and a functional, real-time split-screen preview displaying *finished* projects. The credit system must be adaptive (7 for simple, 14 for complex), and generation should be unlimited in complexity and file count. Users further mandated a highly performant, professional application with a multi-agent architecture, self-learning/self-healing AI, mathematical optimization (Fibonacci/Golden Ratio), intuitive UI, support for generating *all* project types in *all* languages, and a real-time streaming interface similar to Emergent.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with addressing a critical issue identified during a comprehensive end-to-end generation test: a JavaScript project generation failed due to an unspecified timeout or parsing problem. The user explicitly requested to correct or create, optimize and test JavaScript so that it adapts to all eventualities, to the complexity of generation, to increase the timeout or do something else that would best correspond to see if the complete generation works more than better.

The AI engineer has accepted this task and has outlined a plan to achieve this optimization. This plan includes implementing intelligent adaptive timeouts based on complexity, improving parsing mechanisms specifically for JavaScript, developing more robust fallbacks for generation failures, further optimizing the LLM prompts for JavaScript generation, and conducting a full test cycle to validate these changes. The current state reflects a highly evolved system with multi-agent architecture, self-learning capabilities, and mathematical optimizations, but this specific JavaScript generation bug needs to be resolved to ensure the platform lives up to its all project types, all languages promise.

<optional_next_step>
Optimize the JavaScript generation system with adaptive timeouts, improved parsing, robust fallbacks, and optimized prompts, then conduct a full test.
