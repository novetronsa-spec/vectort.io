The deployment of the Vectort.io application to a Contabo server was the central focus of the previous AI engineer's work. This involved a detailed, iterative process of manual instruction-giving to the user, particularly after initial automated deployment scripts failed. Key challenges included correcting DNS records on LWS.fr, integrating numerous API keys (GitHub, SendGrid, Google, Airtable, Stripe) into the backend environment, and meticulously configuring Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, and Certbot. Significant effort was spent debugging Python dependency conflicts within the Dockerized backend (specifically / versions and missing ) and resolving MongoDB connectivity issues from the Docker container to the host. The process culminated in a fully deployed infrastructure, a functional backend API, and a basic frontend, with all critical API keys in place and SSL certificates active.

The overarching goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of emergent.sh, branded as Vectort.io, capable of generating diverse websites. This included: robust authentication, a user dashboard for project management, and an advanced AI generation system supporting 25+ project types (Web App, Mobile, API, E-commerce, etc.) with quick and advanced modes. Key features like microphone-enabled voice-to-text input, and essential business pages (Features, Pricing, FAQs) were required. Emphasis was on 100% functionality, bug-free operation, and strong security. Monetization involved a credit-based pricing system, mirroring Emergent's model (e.g., 100/0, 250/0, 400/0 USD packages), with 10 free credits upon registration and 0 monthly credits. This system necessitated Stripe integration for top-ups. More recently, the user requested advanced functionalities within the project description area, including file upload, GitHub save/fork, an Ultra Mode toggle, and a functional microphone, with an improved UI (buttons below text, larger icons). Finally, full third-party integrations akin to Emergent (GitHub OAuth, SendGrid/Email, AWS S3, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable) and automated deployment to a Contabo server with a custom LWS.fr domain were requested. The current deployment successfully establishes core API and frontend accessibility.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the deployment of the Vectort.io application to the user's Contabo server. This process was largely manual, involving direct execution of commands by the user on their SSH terminal due to previous automation difficulties.

The work accomplished includes:
1.  **DNS Correction**: The user's LWS.fr DNS configuration was verified and corrected, ensuring that , , and  all point to the Contabo server's IP address () by removing a conflicting  record.
2.  **API Key Integration**: All provided third-party API keys (GitHub Client ID/Secret, SendGrid API Key, Google OAuth Client ID/Secret, Airtable API Key) and Stripe live keys were successfully configured in the backend's  file within the  directory on the Contabo server.
3.  **Server Infrastructure Setup**: Key components such as Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Certbot, and MongoDB were installed and configured on the Contabo server.
4.  **Application Code Deployment**: The complete application code, including  (FastAPI backend), , , a basic  for the frontend, and , was created directly on the Contabo server using  commands.
5.  **Dependency Resolution**:
    *   A persistent  was resolved by explicitly updating  to  and .
    *   A  (for Pydantic's ) was resolved by adding  to .
6.  **Docker Networking Fix**: The  file was modified to ensure backend-to-MongoDB connectivity by changing the  to  and setting  for both backend and frontend services.
7.  **SSL/Nginx Configuration**: Nginx was configured with SSL certificates (obtained via Certbot using ) to serve the frontend via  and proxy API requests to the backend via .

The work concluded with successful  tests confirming that the backend API is live and accessible both locally () and publicly (), returning . The frontend is also confirmed to be loading its placeholder page.
