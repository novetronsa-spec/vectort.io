The previous AI engineer laid the groundwork for Vectort.io, establishing core OAuth, multi-platform deployment, monitoring, and an iteration system. However, the current AI engineer inherited an application plagued by critical functional gaps: project generation issues, a non-functional preview (displaying blank screens or raw HTML), and an inaccessible iteration interface. The AI systematically addressed these by building the  and  for a split-screen UI, troubleshooting persistent preview errors (from  blocks to JavaScript syntax errors in generated code, and empty databases due to temporary test data). It also implemented an adaptive credit system via , integrated user-provided OpenAI keys (eventually reverting to ), and added various UI buttons for functionality like file upload and GitHub actions. Continuous diagnosis with  and  agents was crucial, revealing issues such as LLM JSON parsing errors and  import problems. The immediate focus is now on ensuring the 7/14 credit system is respected, the preview consistently shows *finished* projects, and generation is truly unlimited.

The goal is to build Vectort.io, a emergent.sh clone, featuring robust authentication (Google, GitHub, Apple OAuth), advanced AI code generation (25+ project types, quick/advanced modes, voice-to-text), and a credit-based monetization model with Stripe. Key requests include file upload, GitHub save/fork, Ultra Mode, functional microphone, and comprehensive third-party integrations. Recent focus was on multi-LLM capabilities, multi-platform deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Render), and crucially, enabling project iteration/evolution with a conversational interface and a functional, real-time preview. Users explicitly require the application to generate complex, multi-file projects, display a functional split-screen preview (chat left, live preview right) that shows *finished* projects, implement an adaptive credit system (7 credits for simple, 14 for complex), and integrate UI buttons for save to trombone, GitHub, fork, Ultra Mode, file upload, and microphone. The system should first generate a complete application before allowing improvements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing three critical user feedback points. First, the adaptive credit system, configured for 7 credits for simple modifications and 14 for complex ones, was reported by the user as not respected during generation. Second, the real-time preview, despite several previous fixes to display HTML, was still not showing *finished* projects to the user, leading to a disconnect between generated code and visual feedback. Third, the user requested that applications should be coded without limitations, implying the current generation process might be imposing unstated constraints on complexity or completeness. The AI's last action was to acknowledge these problems and explicitly start by investigating why the 7/14 credit system was not being applied, indicating the current work is focused on debugging and correcting the credit estimation and application logic within the backend.
